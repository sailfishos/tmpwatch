Description: |
    The tmpwatch utility recursively searches through specified
    directories and removes files which have not been accessed in a
    specified period of time.  Tmpwatch is normally used to clean up
    directories which are used for temporarily holding files (for example,
    /tmp).  Tmpwatch ignores symlinks, won't switch filesystems and only
    removes empty directories and regular files.

Requires:
    - psmisc
Configure: configure
Builder: make
